----------------     STEPS     --------------------
---------------------------------------------------

1. Open Pure data and click the main toggle to start, remember to turn DISP Audio On (also remember to define the output for the audio in the preferences).

2. Run the code for Processing after changing the IP to yours.

3. Open the TouchDeigner project, go to the home page (symbolised with the emoji of "home" at the top-bar part). Now, select the node of perform, go to the inspector at the right (shortcut "P") and scroll down until you see "Perform in a separate window".


Now you can move the 2Dslider made with processing and start the performance :)
The chapters' order go from left to right and up to down.
