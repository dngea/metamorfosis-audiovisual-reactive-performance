This an audiovisual performance with audio-reactive visuals.

This project is based on the book "The Metamorphosis" by kafka, where I try to sonify the transformation that happens at the beginning of the book.

For this, I divided the transformation into 4 chapters or stages. 

- First is the awakening, where the character slowly wakes up and notices something different.

- Second, the negation and the feeling of being lost. He is turning into an insect, but still has not accepted it.

- Third, where the actual transformation occurs, he is no longer a human and recognises it.

- Fourth and last one, the new reality and acceptance. 


All chapters have different sounds and visuals.
